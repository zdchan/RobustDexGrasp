You should obtain a valid license from raisim.com to use files in 'rasim' and 'doc' folder.

Along with the license, we send an activation key, which is a plain text file.
Before using any raisim functionality, save the file in <$HOME>/.raisim.
If you saved the file somewhere else, you can let raisim know the location of the file using "raisim::World::setActivationKey()".


Source codes in cmake, scripts, examples, raisimGymTorch, raisimMatlab and raisimPy directories are distributed under `MIT <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`_ License.
Feel free to modify them for your project.

Files in rsc and thirdParty are from other opensource projects and the corresponding licenses can be found inside each folder.
